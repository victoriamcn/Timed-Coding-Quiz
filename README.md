### Code Examples
-  CodePen:[Dynamic JS Quiz by Gary Carino](https://codepen.io/gcarino/pen/AaJBOo). Though Gary used jQuery, it helped me think through what needed to happen.
- YouTube: [Build a Quiz App Playlist by James Q Quick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u98ROZjBWy8). James had different approaches, but the concept was similar enough to help me write my code.
