1. **CodePen:** [Dynamic JS Quiz by Gary Carino](https://codepen.io/gcarino/pen/AaJBOo)
- Though Gary used jQuery, it helped me think through what needed to happen.
2. **YouTube:** [Build a Quiz App Playlist by James Q Quick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u98ROZjBWy8)
- James had different approaches, but the concept was similar enough to help me write my code.
